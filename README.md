# GOAL
1️⃣ Convert the malicious file to a .PNG image - ✅  
2️⃣ Image size is 256x256, RGB color - ✅  
3️⃣ Create deep learning CNN model - ✅  
4️⃣ Feed the model with an image of the suspicious file (steps 1-2) - ✅  
5️⃣ Derive how similar the result is to the trained (malicious) content in %.  - ⬜️  
6️⃣ Determine malicious if it is above a certain similarity %, and not malicious if it is below.  - ⬜️
